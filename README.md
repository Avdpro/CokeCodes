# CokeCodes conecpt preview

## What is Cokecodes?
Cokecodes is designed to be a **in-browser** Web/App development environment. It brings the essence of morden OS (like MacOS, Windows, Unix) to the browser. Developers can do all works within browser. Even it's in such early stage, 90% of my coding work is done in browser with CokeCodes tools now.  
  
## Tools and Applictions
Cokecodes currently has a **desktop** and 3 major PWA web app tools: **Terminal**, **Diskit** and **CCEditor**:  
  
- **CCEditor** is a full-functional **code text edtor**. It's based on the great work of **CodeMirror**. It got almost all the cool feaures that morden code editors have: **Syntax highlights**, **Code folding**, **Autocompletion**, **Linter integration**, **Search and replace**, **Bracket and tag matching**, **Marks and todos** and more.  

- **Terminal** is a UNIX terminal like CLI enironment which can run commands (ls, cwd, cd, cp, rm...), apps and scripts.  
  
- **Diskit** is the file manager of CokeCokes system. It works like just **File Explorer** in Windows or **Finder** in MacOS.

  
## Why work in browser?
- **No system contamination**: Setup a new project work environment won't install anything or make any changes out side the browser. Your computer/ device always stay clean. 

- **Domain sandboxed**: You can isolate different projects to avoid annoying package/tool version conflict which do happens a lot these days. Remove a sandbox cleans everthing, no trush left behind.

- **Same experience**: CokeCodes' tool and applications works just as good as similar tools run in native. They launch in a blink, and run smoothly the in browsers. All tools are open sourced and support addons to expand their features.   

- **Any device, any time**: Browsers are best cross-platform-environment out there. Cokecodes can run on all morden major browsers on desktop or mobile devices. With it's inbuilt cloud feature, you can easily pick up your work any where, any time. 

## It's all about productivity
- **Work offline**: As PWA apps, all Cokecodes tools/apps can work offline so you won't concern about the network connection while working. 

- **Cloud repository**: Projects (disks) in Cokecodes file system can be synced with CokeCodes cloud repository. You can access your works anytime, anywhere, on any devices. More public clouds support is on the way.

- **Packages**: Cokecodes has a **npm** like package system. Libs, tools and apps are deliverd as packages. With minor modifications, most node packages can be port into browser. You can install, update packages to setup or enhance your coding power. You can make your own packages and share with others too. 

## Open to power
CokeCodes' system, applictions and command tools are all write in pure Javascript and all **open source**. You can easily make your own tools, addons even applications to aid your work and share with others. You can host your own cokecodes server, too.

## Incomming more
This version of Cokecodes is just a concept preview. Current Cokecodes is in it's very early stage. So I am not recommanding to use CokeCodes as real development tool for now. More features are incomming, check the **Roadmap** below and stay tunned!

## Dev road map:
- Better mobile devices (phones and tablets) support
- Port packaging tools like **webpack** and **rollup**
- More documents
- Self-host cokecodes server setup
- Sync disk with locale folder
- File system **watch** feature
- Sync file access solution
- Server mockup/develop mechanism with database simulator
- Sync disk with other repository like GitHub, DropBox
- CCEdit support more coding language (PY/ C,C++ /Java...)
- Port **Emscripten** to enable C++ and other WASM developments
- Python support
- Mobile app wrap and publish
- **Cody**: powerful WYSWYG UI-Builder tool behind the major CokeCodes apps.

## Like the idea?
Cokecodes is my hobby project. Although it's very simple and rough, cokecodes is indeed working and looks really promising. My earlier web/app development tool chain is node+WebStorm, now my work is done 90% in browser. Hope with new incomming features, it hits 100%!
